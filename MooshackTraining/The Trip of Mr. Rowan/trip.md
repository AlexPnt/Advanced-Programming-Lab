###The Trip of Mr. Rowan

Mr. Rowan plans to make a walking tour of Paris. However, since he is a little lazy, he wants to take the shortest path that goes through all the places he wants to visit. He plans to take a bus to the first place and another one back from the last place, so he is free to choose the starting and ending places. Can you help him?

##Input

The first line of input contains the number of places to visit (n). Then, in the following n lines, you find the coordinates of each place to visit.

Here is an example: 

    3
    132 73
    49 86
    72 111

##Output

For each test case, your program should output one line containing the minimum distance that Mr. Rowan must walk to visit all places assuming that the walking distance from one place to another is the Euclidean distance. The algorithm should output a number in fixed-point notation with exactly 3 digits to the right of the decimal point and no leading space. There are at most 12 places to visit.
